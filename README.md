#Flatfreeze

Flatfreeze is a tutorial project to quickly build a custom static website generator.
It is nothing more than a Flask project using [Frozen-Flask](http://pythonhosted.org/Frozen-Flask/)
and [Flask-FlatPages](http://pythonhosted.org/Flask-FlatPages/), hosted
on [Github Pages](http://pages.github.com/). When put together it gives you the advantage of:

+ Custom domain name;
+ Git revision control for both application and static site;
+ Jinja templating;
+ Free and excellent hosting on Github Pages;
+ Versatility: not tied to blogging, but you can easily make a blog;
+ Writing your articles in eye-pleasing Markdown;
+ Compactness: less than 60 lines of Python.
